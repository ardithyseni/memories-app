Memories App is a full-stack MERN Web Application. It is a social media app that allows users to post 
interesting events with an image. The app also features comments, recommended posts, 
authentication, including Google OAuth 2 (Google Sign-in).

Developed by me following the JavaScript Mastery YouTube Course.
